## Summary

This project was a great challenge because, I needed to use arrays, functions, MathRandom functions! Also, I needed to find creative ways to increase the score count in the web browser! It was an a great way to use CSS Styling and get a bit creative with colors and images, Last but not least in was a challenge to code the logic that would determine the outcome of all of the different variations that would be the outcome of each game.
