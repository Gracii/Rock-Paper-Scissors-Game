## Summary

Created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this Rock-Paper-Scissors game follows the classic and straightforward rule set. This project presented a delightful challenge, as it required the use of arrays, functions, and the Math.random() function. It also involved finding innovative ways to track and update the score within the web browser. The CSS styling aspect allowed for the utilization of CSS flexbox to arrange game elements, offering opportunities for creative color and image choices. During this project, I gained experience in simplifying complex game logic and writing clean, modern ES6 code. Last but not least, it was a rewarding challenge to code the logic for determining the outcomes of all possible game variations by creating an AI opponent to play against.
